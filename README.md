# Triangle-Solver
Given a triangle (in numerous different ways, depending on what is known), this will solve for all the missing information that it can
This program will take in a triangle based on input (ex: base and height, three sides, etc.) and output as much information as it can about the triangle. The program also has a subclass specifically for right triangles, as oftentimes there are different procedures used for them. This was something I found useful in class when, given limited information about a triangle, we were required to list as much as we could about the triangle based on the given info. In said program, I also made my own exceptions for times where calculations could not be performed due to preconditions (ex: trying to create triangles that cannot exist or attempting to create triangles with negative angles or side lengths).
